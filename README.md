# Yacht-Hydrodynamics-Linear-Regression-
Application of Linear Regression on Yacht Hydrodynamics Data Set (UCI) in python. 
This uses numpy, statsmodel and matplotlib libraries.

Data was taken from: UCI Machine Learning Repository

General Information:
1. No of attributes = 6 + 1.
2. No of instances = 308.
3. Missing Values = N/A.
4. Task = Regression.

Attribute Information: 
1. Longitudinal position of the center of buoyancy, adimensional. 
2. Prismatic coefficient, adimensional. 
3. Length-displacement ratio, adimensional.
